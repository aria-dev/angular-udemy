Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. [Learn more at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework))
